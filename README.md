# Data-Science-in-Economics_BEF2041
In this page, it contains the group's code on US Commodity trade data
Usually, in a smaller task we can just compile the code offline 
When we encounter a *BIG* Files, it is much easier if we can collaborate on the data and the code
We use this repository to demonstrate Version control and collaborate on a datasets.

This data set is a little messy from doing analysis directly, so we will have to utilise command line tools to clean out the data first
using command we have learnt in class such as grep, cut and head to clean the data,

Then we can use the awk, which is a tool that reads a file line-by-line, it splits the text into "fields" based on the seperator such as pipe |

This is quite an interesting exercise for everyone to have some practice on linux command line ^_^

Some questions you can work on:

How would you make predictions about future trade patterns using the data provided? 

What other methods could have been used to clean/analyse the data

What key factors have made GitHub the dominant platform for developer collaboration compared to competitors?
