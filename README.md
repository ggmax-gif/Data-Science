## Project Overview

Analysing a decade of global merchandise trade (2014-2024) using **Linux command-line tools** and **GitHub collaboration**. This project demonstrates how to efficiently clean and analyse large datasets using AWK, grep, and other Unix utilities. We used the [UN Comtrade Database](https://comtradeplus.un.org/) covering 180+ countries to explore international trade patterns.

### Research Questions

1. How have global trade patterns evolved from 2014 to 2024?
2. What was COVID-19's impact on international trade?
3. Which countries experienced the most significant growth?

## Command-Line Tools

Linux tools were used to clean and analyse the data efficiently:

```bash
head    # Preview data
cut     # Extract columns
grep    # Filter patterns
sort    # Order data
awk     # Process & compile data line-by-line
```

## Takeaway Questions

Key questions extending beyond our presentation analysis:

1. **Predictive Modeling**: How would you forecast future trade patterns using the dataset provided?

2. **Alternative Methods**: Compare command-line efficiency vs Python/R/Excel for datasets of this size.

3. **GitHub's Dominance**: What factors made GitHub the dominant platform for collaboration compared to competitors?

4. **Code Optimisation**: How would you modify the AWK code to calculate percentage growth instead of absolute values?
